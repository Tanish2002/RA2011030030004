# Question 1
The code is in golang.
I've included the vendor folder so one can just run the code using `go run main.go` It'll run the server on port 8080

# Question 2
The frontend is in next.js 13.
Download the node_modules using `pnpm install`.
Run the frontedn using `pnpm dev`. The frontend will run on port 3000.
